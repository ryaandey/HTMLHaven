<p> West Bengal is located in eastern India, bordered by Bangladesh to the east, the Himalayas to the north, and the Bay of Bengal to the south.<br>
    The state features a diverse landscape, including the lush green plains of the Ganges delta, the hilly terrains of Darjeeling, and the Sundarbans mangrove forests, which are home to the Royal Bengal Tiger.<br>
    The region experiences a subtropical climate, with heavy monsoon rains contributing to its fertile agriculture.<br>
    The interplay of rivers, hills, and forests makes West Bengal one of Indiaâ€™s most ecologically rich states.</p>
